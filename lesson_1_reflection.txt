How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	Viewing a diff instantly shows me where the differences between the two files 	are and it is much easier to find the bug that way.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

	It allows us to easily refer back to an old file to search for mistakes in 		case we made any unintentional mistakes and have no idea where we made them.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    	Pros: You get to control when to save.
	Cons: You might accidentally close the file before getting to save anything. 	Or sometimes there might be unexpected computer errors that force closed to 	file.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    	Because programs often requires several files to function properly.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    	git log shows the history of files, git diff specifically shows the 			difference between two files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    	We can always go back for the older files even if we did break something.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    	Version control.
